# fruit-ai
# this a project of fruit-ai.
# At first you have to download node modules in both frontend and backend.
# Then in env file of backend you have to put your mongo URI to store data , I am using mongo for backend beacuse i have very little knowledge of flask , django and python to use it as a database.
# i have deployed only frontend with usernams = "user" and password = "password".
